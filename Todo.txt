1. Run synthetic with discrete LFs with and without precision constraint on just two LFs.
Make sure the parameters we obtain agree with what we hand calculate.

2.  Repeat the above with two parameters per LFs.

3.  Move to half-gaussian continuous attributes and make sure the parameters that are learned with the
matched potential form are again consistent with hand-calculated values.

4.  Write testcases in CodeTest.ipny for various probability and precision loss computations.

5. Test on datasets with several high-quality continuous LFs, e.g. dedup, classification datasets with keywords
